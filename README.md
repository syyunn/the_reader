The Reader (2008) is a romantic dram film directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, based on the 1995 German novel of the same name by Bernhard Schlink. 

The film tells the story of Michael Berg, a German lawyer who, as a mid-teenager in 1958, has an affair with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz, who then disappears only to resurface years later as one of the defendants in a war crimes trial stemming from her actions as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. Michael realizes that Hanna is keeping a personal secret she believes is worse than her Nazi past â€“ a secret which, she is illiterate.

This film touches the question about `"How righteously can we blame an individual who had supported historical evil events after the ambiance of society had already being shifted and led to the evil direction?"` with a story of common, normal person - who was absoultely politically powerless in those days of extremes.  

As [Hannah Arendt][2] has introduced in her book [Eichmann in Jerusalem : A Report on the Banality of Evil][3], the term `Banality of Evil` well tackles this points since she insists that the Nazi officer Eichmann, who transported millions of Jews to concentration camps, was also just motivated by `extremly ordinary reason - family and career` and he was not amoral monster or psychopathic sadist as we might wrongly misunderstand. 

Upon the recognition of the movie's story line and its implication,  let's talk about following questions: 

>  First, let's share each one of us's thoughts and feeling about movie in totally free manner.

> Second, How often do you regard something as `Evil` or `Immoral`? How of those frame impacts your life? Do you belive the `Goodness` or `Evilness` innately resides in nature? or Do you believe the morality itself is collectively constructed by the members of society? 

> Third, as a continuum of second question, there exists a prolonged dillemma of humankind -  about `root of morality`.  If we purely find a root of morality from the social agreement, there's a risk of might-be-unaceeptable actions like genocide being justified under the excue of poltical agreement. On the other hand, if we find a root of morality purely from the nature, the moral judgement could be too much stiff to reflect the rapid change of society. How do you think we can resolve this dillemma? Do you have any compromising points in your daily life similiar to this dillemma? if so, let's share and talk about wise way of dealing with the life-long inevitable object, `morality`. This question is not just confined in a societal and historical level, but encompasses our individual and daily life.
